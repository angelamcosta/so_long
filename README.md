A basic 2D game where a character must collect all the collectibles and escape the map. The game uses the MiniLibX library for graphics.

## üìñ Description

You must create a basic 2D game in which a dolphin escapes Earth after eating some fish. **Instead of a dolphin, fish, and the Earth, you can use any character, any collectible, and any place you want**. Your project must comply with the following rules:

### üéÆ Game
- The player‚Äôs goal is to collect every collectible present on the map, then escape choosing the shortest possible route.
- The W, A, S, and D keys must be used to move the main character.
- The player should be able to move in these 4 directions: up, down, left, right.
- The player should not be able to move into walls.
- At every move, the current number of movements must be displayed in the shell.
- You have to use a 2D view (top-down or profile).
- The game doesn‚Äôt have to be real-time.
- Although the given examples show a dolphin theme, you can create the world you want.

### üé® Graphic Management
- Your program has to display the image in a window.
- The management of your window must remain smooth (changing to another window, minimizing, and so forth).
- Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.
- Clicking on the cross on the window‚Äôs frame must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.
- The use of the images of the MiniLibX is mandatory.

### üó∫Ô∏è Map
- The map has to be constructed with 3 components: walls, collectibles, and free space.
- The map can be composed of only these 5 characters:
  - 0 for an empty space,
  - 1 for a wall,
  - C for a collectible,
  - E for a map exit,
  - P for the player‚Äôs starting position.
- The map must contain at least 1 exit, 1 collectible, and 1 starting position.
- The map must contain only 1 starting position and 1 exit.
- The map must be rectangular.
- The map must be closed/surrounded by walls. If it‚Äôs not, the program must return an error.
- You don‚Äôt have to check if there‚Äôs a valid path in the map.
- You must be able to parse any kind of map, as long as it respects the above rules.
- If any misconfiguration of any kind is encountered in the file, the program must exit in a clean way, and return "Error\n" followed by an explicit error message of your choice.

## üöÄ Usage

To compile the game, navigate to the files/ directory and run the following command:

```shell
make
```

This will generate an executable named so_long.

To launch the game, use the following command:

```shell
./so_long map.ber
```

- `map.ber` is a map description file in the format *.ber.

## ‚ú® Features

- Basic 2D game with a character, collectibles, and a map.
- Player movement using W, A, S, D and arrow keys.
- Collectibles must be collected to win the game.
- Display of the current number of movements in the shell.
- Clean window management with ESC key and window close button.
- Map parsing and error handling.
